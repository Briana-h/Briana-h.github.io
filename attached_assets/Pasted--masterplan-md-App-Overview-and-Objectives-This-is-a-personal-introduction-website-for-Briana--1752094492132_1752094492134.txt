## App Overview and Objectives

This is a personal introduction website for Briana, designed to showcase her creative portfolio and attract internship recruiters in landscape architecture and design. The site will highlight her contact information, artwork, and professional background, with a clean and professional design.

## Target Audience

* Internship recruiters and potential employers in landscape architecture and design fields.

## Core Features and Functionality

* **Homepage:** Welcoming message and personal photo.
* **About Me Section:** Placeholder for a personal bio and professional introduction.
* **Portfolio Gallery:** A visual showcase of artwork and sketches with optional captions.
* **Work Experience/Resume Section:** Placeholder for a downloadable resume or work history highlights.
* **Contact Section:**

  * LinkedIn profile link (placeholder)
  * Email address (placeholder)
  * Optional contact form (name, email, message)

## High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

* **Platform:** Squarespace or Wix (recommended for visual ease and quick setup)
* **Hosting:** Built-in with the chosen platform
* **CMS (if needed):** Included with platform, no separate CMS required

## Conceptual Data Model

No database needed for this simple site. Static content will suffice:

* Image uploads (photo, artwork)
* Text content (bio, contact info, captions)

## User Interface Design Principles

* Clean, minimal design with a professional aesthetic
* Mobile-responsive layout
* Clear visual hierarchy with large, readable text
* Emphasis on visuals in the portfolio section

## Artistic & Aesthetic Design Elements

* **Color Palette:** Earthy tones (greens, browns, beiges) paired with neutral backgrounds to reflect nature and design.
* **Typography:** Elegant serif font for headings (e.g., Playfair Display) and a clean sans-serif for body text (e.g., Lato or Open Sans).
* **Layout:** Generous white space, grid-based gallery layout, asymmetrical sections for modern flair.
* **Imagery:** High-resolution sketches and artwork with light drop shadows or frames to enhance presentation.
* **Subtle Motion:** Soft hover effects, fade-in transitions for text, and gentle scrolling animations to give life to the page.
* **Consistency:** Repeating visual motifs or linework that nods to architectural design (e.g., fine lines, structure-inspired borders).

## Security Considerations

* HTTPS enabled (standard with most site builders)
* Use platform’s built-in spam protection for contact forms
* Avoid exposing personal email directly if possible (use a contact form or obfuscation)

## Development Phases or Milestones

1. Choose a website builder (e.g., Squarespace or Wix)
2. Set up structure with basic pages: Home, About, Portfolio, Contact
3. Add placeholders for:

   * Personal photo
   * Bio/description
   * Artwork/images
   * Resume or work experience
   * LinkedIn and email info
4. Customize design and layout with aesthetic elements
5. Preview and test across devices
6. Publish the site

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

* **Image formatting or quality issues:** Optimize images before uploading
* **Finding the right layout:** Start with a template and tweak as needed
* **Content updates:** Choose a builder with easy editing tools

## Future Expansion Possibilities

* Add blog posts or project case studies
* Include a password-protected area for private work
* Enable visitors to download your resume
* Integrate social media or Behance/Dribbble if relevant
