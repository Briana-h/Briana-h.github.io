              Hello! I'm Briana, a passionate creative exploring color, form, and emotion through diverse mediums and techniques. 
              My artistic journey spans from traditional drawing and painting to digital design and multimedia projects.

              This is my personal portfolio where I share artwork, design projects, and experiences that inspire me.
